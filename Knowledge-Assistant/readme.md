## 🧠 Databricks AI Agent — Knowledge Assistant

An intelligent **AI Agent** powered by **Databricks Llama-4** models that combines text reasoning and vision understanding to deliver context-rich results from multiple sources.

### 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how **AI agents** can reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously using multiple tools. The agent leverages:

* 🧩 **Wikipedia** — for factual and educational summaries.
* 🎥 **YouTube Search** — to fetch relevant video tutorials or talks.

Together, these enable a **multimodal workflow** that blends textual and visual intelligence — a foundation for AI assistants that can research, reason, and explain like humans.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Databricks Llama-4 Maverick** (text reasoning)
* **LangChain** (agent orchestration)
* **DuckDuckGo Search API**
* **Wikipedia API**

### 🧩 Sample Query

```
Summarize neural networks from Wikipedia and list 2 YouTube videos.
```

### 💡 Key Features

* Zero-shot reasoning and planning with tool invocation
* Seamless integration of textual + visual information
* Structured, human-readable responses
