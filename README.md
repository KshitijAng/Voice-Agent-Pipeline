# ðŸ¤– Introduction to Agentic AI  

This repository showcases a series of implementations exploring the foundations of **Agentic AI** â€” systems capable of autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and tool interaction.  

It serves as a practical learning space where various **agent behaviors** are demonstrated, including:  
- Multi-step task planning and execution  
- Integration with external tools and APIs  
- Autonomous data retrieval and reasoning  
- Real-world action through goal-driven intelligence  



### ðŸ§  Significance  
Agentic AI represents a major shift from static conversational models to **dynamic, self-directed AI systems** that can act, reason, and learn from their environment.
